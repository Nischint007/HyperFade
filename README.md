# 🌐 HyperFade — Designing in Motion

**HyperFade** is not just a portfolio — it's a creative statement.  
Every pixel, transition, and interaction has been crafted by me from the ground up — from the UI/UX design to the final lines of code.

This site reflects my approach to modern frontend development: bold visuals, smooth motion, and a deep focus on how design feels in motion — not just how it looks.

## 🎬 About the Experience

HyperFade was designed to feel cinematic and interactive — almost like a digital stage. Built entirely with **GSAP** and enhanced by **Lenis.js** for buttery-smooth scrolling, the site responds to every scroll and hover with fluidity.

The custom cursor follows the user's intent, transforming on hover, adapting to different sections. Every animation is part of a bigger timeline — orchestrated through **GSAP’s timeline control**, allowing layered and immersive transitions.

The full-screen navigation isn't just a menu — it’s an entrance to another layer of the site, animated using chained timelines for smooth storytelling.

## 📌 Creator’s Note

This portfolio is a personal project, but created with the intention and polish of a creative studio. It’s built to push boundaries — not just to display work, but to **feel like work itself**. 
The motion, the transitions, the responsiveness — everything reflects who I am as a designer and developer.
